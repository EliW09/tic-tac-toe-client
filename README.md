Description:
  My Tic-Tac-Toe allows you to play the game for both sides and requires you make an account so you can have your games saved to see how many games you have played.

Process:
  I started my project looking at documentation and jumping right into HTML and CSS for a basic setup. After getting my board on the screen I started the javascript setting up events and doing game function one by one. After my game logic was complete I redesigned my game and went into user auth than implimented the game function to the api to allow for games to be saved.

User stories:
As a user, I want to be able to click on a cell and display my move based on the turn
As a user, I want the game to announce who won, or if it was a tie
As a user, I want to be able to play against myself but in the future add an AI system (stretch goal)
As a user, I want to be able to see how many games i've completed
As a user, I want to be able to make an account to save my games and change my password
As a user, I want to see my name when I login to my account

Unsolved problems:
  Organize all of my code and clean up my functions to allow for less code blocks and faster interaction on the webpage. Also would like to make an AI to play against.
